💌 Email Spam Classifier 🧠

📌 Overview
This project is a machine learning-based email spam classifier built using Python. It aims to automatically detect whether a given email is spam or not spam (ham) based on its textual content.

🚀 Key Features
Cleaned and preprocessed raw email text data

Used TF-IDF Vectorization for text feature extraction

Implemented models like:

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Achieved high accuracy and performance on test data

Visualized key insights and model metrics (like confusion matrix, accuracy score)

🧰 Technologies Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Scikit-learn

Pandas, Numpy

Matplotlib 

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

📊 Model Evaluation
Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Model effectively classifies most spam/ham emails with strong generalization

📁 Dataset
Used a labeled dataset of email messages with spam and ham labels
